Cab Fare Predictions
—In this report, the fare amount of a cab ride is detected using machine learning
algorithms. From the given train_data, a feature set of distance is created from the pickup and drop-off
latitude and longitude. From the datetime variable features like year and hour of travel are extracted which
affect the fare prices. Using this feature data, different models are built: Decision Tree, Linear Regression,
Random Forest, KNN classifier. Final prediction is of the fare amount of the given test_data, which only have
latitude and longitude columns. From the given model’s best error rates was with Random Forest model,
which is then implemented on the given test data for the final fare prediction.
